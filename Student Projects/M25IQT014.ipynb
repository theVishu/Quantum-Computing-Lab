My name is Vishu Kumar, and I am pursuing M.Tech in Quantum Technologies. My roll number is M25IQT014. As part of my learning and experimentation in quantum computation and quantum information science, I have developed a Quantum-Inspired Random Number Generator (QRNG) model that utilizes the concept of quantum superposition, probability measurement, and mathematical amplification.

In this work, a qubit initialized in the |0⟩ state is first brought into a state of superposition using the Hadamard transformation, making it exist in both |0⟩ and |1⟩ simultaneously with equal probability amplitude. Instead of directly using the binary output obtained after measurement, I repeatedly measure the qubit to estimate its probability distribution, and then extract one of the probabilities to mathematically amplify it into an integer form. This approach demonstrates how quantum randomness and classical post-processing can be combined to generate unpredictable numerical outputs.

The implementation is executed in Python using Qiskit, and the experimental results are analyzed by running the generator multiple times to study distribution patterns and repetition frequencies.
This project reflects my interest in bridging quantum theory, algorithmic thinking, and practical experimentation, and contributes to my continuous journey in understanding quantum-based randomness and computation.

def quantum_rng_amplified(shots=2000):

    P0 = counts.get('0', 0) / shots
    P1 = counts.get('1', 0) / shots

    print(f"Measured Probabilities: P(0)={P0:.4f},  P(1)={P1:.4f}")

    # STEP 3: Select one probability (choose the larger one)
    chosen_prob = P1 if P1 > P0 else P0
    print(f"Chosen probability for amplification: {chosen_prob:.4f}")

    # STEP 4: Amplify using equation → integer
    amplified_value = int(math.exp(chosen_prob * 10) * 1000)

    return amplified_value
