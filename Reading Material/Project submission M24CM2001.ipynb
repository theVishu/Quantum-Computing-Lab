# --- 1. Circuit Initialization ---
# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits (q0, q1) and 2 classical bits (c0, c1)
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# --- 2. State Preparation: Creating the |Phi+> Bell State ---
# The circuit starts in the computational basis state |00>.

# Step 1: Apply a Hadamard gate (H) to the first qubit (q0).
# This creates a superposition: |0> -> 1/sqrt(2) * (|0> + |1>)
# The overall state becomes: 1/sqrt(2) * (|00> + |10>)
qc.h(0)

# Step 2: Apply a Controlled-NOT gate (CNOT) using q0 as control and q1 as target.
# The CNOT gate flips the target qubit (q1) only if the control (q0) is in state |1>.
# This creates the entanglement:
# 1/sqrt(2) * (|00> + |10>) -> 1/sqrt(2) * (|00> + |11>)

# We measure the qubits in the computational basis.
